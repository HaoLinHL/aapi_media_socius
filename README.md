## 📖 Project Description

**Who counts as “Asian American”?**  
Prior survey research suggests that **South Asian Americans** are less likely to be recognized as Asian Americans compared with **East Asian Americans**. This project investigates how mainstream U.S. newspapers represent Asian subethnic groups over time.

Using a national news dataset and NLP techniques, the visualization shows annual trends (1977–2022) in mentions of three groups when discussing “Asian Americans”:

- **East Asian Americans**  
- **South Asian Americans**  
- **Southeast Asian Americans**

### Key Findings
- East Asians are most frequently mentioned when discussing Asian Americans.  
- South Asians and Southeast Asians appear less often.  
- These disparities are consistent over time, indicating that unequal representation is **institutionalized in news media**.
